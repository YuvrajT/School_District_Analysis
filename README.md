# School District Analysis

## Overview 

### Purpose 
- To provide school board with insights on how students are performing in Math and
Reading for different schools from grades 9th to 12th.
- Analyze the impact on averages and other variables caused by academic dishonestly in
Thomas High School in grade 9th for math and reading scores.

### Results:


Academic dishonesty was only found in the grade 9th of Thomas High School for Math and
Reading scores, scores were changed to NaN. Since this is very small change compared the data
we have for 15 different schools from grade 9th to 12th. Results show very minimal decrease in
variables:

#### Affect on Disctrict Summary: 

- With grades changed to NaN, naturally the average numbers have decreased by few but % overall passing has increased significantly from 65.17% to 90.63%

### Affect on School Summay:

- Grades were only changed for Thomas High School, thus it will not have impact on other school's individual summary. But it definitely had an impact on Thomas High School performance. 

### Thomas High School (THS) Performance:

- Looking at highlighted THS, clearly it had a major impact on all calculated percentages ("% passing math, passing reading and Overall). With overall passing percentage dropped from 90% to 65%

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade:

- The change of grade was only for Thomas high school for 9th grade only. Therefore, when calucating math and reading score by grade, it resulted in NaN.

No Changes were reflected for "Scores by school spending", "Scores by school size" and "Scores by school type". Reasong being from the total student count of 39,170 only 461 students were in 9th of THS. That is a very small number comapared to the total and also we have calcuated averages for the required results. 

## Summary

- Average Math score dropped from 83.41% to 83.35% very marginal change
- % Passing Math dropped from 93.27% to 66.91%. 
- % Passing Reading dropped from 97.30% to 69.66%
- % Overall passing dropped from 90.94% to 65.07
